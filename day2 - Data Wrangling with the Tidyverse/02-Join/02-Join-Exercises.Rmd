# mutating joins

```{r}
band %>% left_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% right_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% full_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% inner_join(instrument, by = "name")
```


## Your Turn 1

Which airlines had the largest arrival delays? Complete the code below.

1. Join `airlines` to `flights`
2. Compute and order the average arrival delays by airline. Display full names, no codes.

*(Hint: Be sure to remove each `_` before running the code)*

```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")  %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay))  %>%
  arrange(delay) 
```


## Your Turn 2

Join `flights` and `airports`. 

Then for each `name`, compute the `distance` from NYC and the average `arr_delay`.  *Hint: use `first()` to get the first value of distance.*

Order by average delay, worst to best.

*(Hint: Be sure to remove each `_` before running the code)*

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(distance = first(distance), 
               delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
  arrange(desc(delay))
```


# filtering joins

```{r}
band %>% semi_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% anti_join(instrument, by = "name")
```

## Your Turn 3

How many airports in `airports` are serviced by flights in `flights`? (i.e. how many places can you fly to direct from New York?) 

Notice that the column to join on is named `faa` in the **airports** data set and `dest` in the **flights** data set.

```{r}
airports %>%
 semi_join(flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  distinct(faa)
```


# Take aways

* `left_join()` retains all cases in _left_ data set
* `right_join()` retains all cases in _right_ data set
* `full_join()` retains all cases in _either_ data set
* `inner_join()` retains _only_ cases in _both_ data sets

* `semi_join()` extracts cases that _have_ a match
* `anti_join()` extracts cases that _do not have_ a match
